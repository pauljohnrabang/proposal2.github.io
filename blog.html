                    <p>f you have plans on becoming great, you’ll want to read this brief article.

They say success leaves clues; this implies, “if we look at people who are great, we’d find a common denominator, a golden thread tying them all together.”</p>

                    <p>Here’s what I think we’d find:
We’d find people who discovered their talent and then showcased that talent to the world in a “new” and creative way.
Most of the people we’d find wouldn’t be doing anything “new.”  They would be doing something that’s been done before, in a “new” and unique way.</p>
                    <p>There’s nothing new under the sun
Take Thomas Edison the inventor of the everyday light bulb as an example; many scientist of his day knew that a heated piece of carbon filament would produce a light.  However, the light would only last for a brief moment.</p>
                    <p>…So what did Edison do?
Did Edison come up with a new idea?  No; Edison improved upon an existing idea through creativity and concentration, by finding a carbon filament that would burn for over 1500 hours if enclosed in an oxygen free case.  It wasn’t a new idea, but his improvement on an existing idea made him great, while most people don’t even remember who invented the first electric light bulb.  It was Humphry Davy back in 1800, in case you were wondering.</p>   
                    <p>Becoming Great
To become great we must focus our attention on developing our unique and dominant gifts.
The full unhindered expression of our creativity is what can make all of us great.</p>
                    <p>Remember: There’s always room at the top for those who are dedicated to greatness, so whatever you do, do it well or not at all.</p>
